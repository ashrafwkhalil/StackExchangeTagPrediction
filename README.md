# Stack Exchange Question Tag Assignment
#### SOEN 471/SOEN 6111 - Big Data

## Project Definition
Thousands of questions are asked on Stack Exchange everyday, which makes navigating through the vast collection of questions difficult. Question tagging is a feature that helps categorize a question broadly, in an attempt of grouping questions of similar topics or fields together. The goal of our project is to appropriately predict these tags for questions that were asked by users of [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com).
